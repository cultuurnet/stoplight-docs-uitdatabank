# Introduction

Each year, over 28,000 organisers enter more than 215,000 activities happening in Flanders and Brussels into in the UiTdatabase free of charge.

Enter your planned activity just once into the UiTdatabase and it is widely broadcast on a whole range of information sources, online and offline. Obviously on our very own UiTinVlaanderen.be, UiTmetVlieg.be, BILL.be and UiTPAS.be. But that is just for starters. In addition, your activity is also included in over 500 print and digital Whatâ€™s On guides run by local or national media, authorities and organisations.
